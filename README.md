A classic Memory Game

credit to Ania Kobow for the YouTube tutorial on the code for this game. I designed all the cards and card backs myself in Adobe Illustrator and changed the styling of the webpage to make it my own.

I also changed from using the pop-up alerts she used to using textContent to display the messages directly on the page.
