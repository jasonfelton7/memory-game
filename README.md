A classic Memory Game

credit to Ania Kobow for the YouTube tutorial on the code for this game. I designed all the cards and card backs myself in Adobe Illustrator and changed the styling of the webpage to make improve the look.

I also changed from using pop-up alerts to using textContent to display the messages directly on the page.

In addition, I added extra cards that make up a fourth row.
